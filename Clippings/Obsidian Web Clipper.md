*File over app* is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.

  

*File over app* is an appeal to tool makers: accept that all software is ephemeral, and give people ownership over their data.

  

In the fullness of time, the files you create are more important than the tools you use to create them. Apps are ephemeral, but your files have a chance to last.

  

The ancient temples of Egypt contain hieroglyphs that were chiseled in stone thousands of years ago. The ideas hieroglyphs convey are more important than the type of chisel that was used to carve them.

  

The world is filled with ideas from generations past, transmitted through many mediums, from clay tablets to manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, and tapestries. These artifacts are objects that you can touch, hold, own, store, preserve, and look at. To read something written on paper all you need is eyeballs.

The encoder is composed of a stack of $N=6$ identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection \[^11\] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization \[^1\]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is $\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x))$, where $\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)$ is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension $d\_{\\text{model}}=512$.

==Information moves, or we move to it.== Moving to it has rarely been popular and is growing unfashionable; nowadays we demand that the information come to us. ==This can be accomplished in three basic ways: moving physical media around, broadcasting radiation through space, and sending signals through wires.== This article is about what will, for a short time anyway, be the biggest and best wire ever made.

  

==Wires warp cyberspace in the same way wormholes warp physical space: the two points at opposite ends of a wire are, for informational purposes, the same point, even if they are on opposite sides of the planet.== The cyberspace-warping power of wires, therefore, changes the geometry of the world of commerce and politics and ideas that we live in. The financial districts of New York, London, and Tokyo, linked by thousands of wires, are much closer to each other than, say, the Bronx is to Manhattan.

  

Today this is all quite familiar, but in the 19th century, when the first feeble bits struggled down the first undersea cable joining the Old World to the New, ==it must have made people's hair stand up on end in more than just the purely electrical sense – it must have seemed supernatural.==
